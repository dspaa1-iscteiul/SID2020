# SID2020
App do Projeto de SID para monitorização dos sensores e lançamento de alertas

Android App that I modified including a notification system and made some improvements on the GUI. This app was part of a bigger project of Distributed Information Systems course.
The focus of the project was to migrate data through different databases (physical sensors -> MongoDB -> MySQL -> Android SQLite) until the final user can visualize it on the device.
